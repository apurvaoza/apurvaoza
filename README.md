-👋🏾👋🏾 Hi, I’m @apurvaoza, author of "Desorbing Interiors via Satellite Heating to Observe Outgassing Model" : DISHOOM ☄️☄️.
- 👀 I’m interested in planetary astrophysics. Specifically atmospheric escape and evolution on [exo]planets. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to optimize spacecraft data to better understand infrared hotspot signatures due to volcanism 🌋🌋 on Jupiter's moon Io and exo-Ios.
- 🙆🏽 I’m looking to collaborate on a survey to identify extrasolar moons (exomoons) in échelle spectrograph data of transiting exoplanets.
